<h1>MATH</h1>
<p>Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantity, and space, a science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved
from elementary practices like counting and measuring. Its development involves logical reasoning and the increasing
abstraction of its subject matter, with modern math exploring abstract entities defined by axioms. The field is broadly
divided into pure mathematics, which explores abstract concepts for their own sake, and applied mathematics, which uses
mathematical principles to solve real-world problems.</p>

    <h1>SCIENCE</h1>
    <p>Science is the process of systematically using observation and experimentation to gain knowledge about the natural and
    social world. It is both a body of knowledge and a dynamic process of discovery, which organizes this knowledge through
    testable hypotheses and predictions. Science is broadly divided into natural sciences (like physics and biology), social
    sciences (like psychology), and formal sciences (like mathematics).</p>

    <h1>GEOMETRY</h1>
    <p>Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of space, including shape, size, and the relative
    position of figures. It is one of the oldest mathematical sciences, originally developed from practical problems like
    surveying, and is used today in fields ranging from physics to computer science. Key concepts include points, lines,
    angles, surfaces, and solids.</p>
